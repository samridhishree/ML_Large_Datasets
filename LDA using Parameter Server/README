This is an implementation of LDA with Gibbs Sampling using a Parameter server. 

Parameter server (PS) is an abstraction for distributed, data-parallel ML. Each worker holds a partition of the dataset but has access to the full model parameters stored on the server machines through a fully connected bipartite network topology. Petuum's Bosen PS is used in this implementation using JBosen, a minimal Java version of Bosen. The source code and details about JBosen can be found at: https://github.com/petuum/jbosen.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a generative model that represents set of documents as mixtures of topics or clusters. Gibbs Sampling is used to estimate the model from the given data.
