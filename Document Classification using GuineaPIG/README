Document classifier (Naive Bayes) using the Hadoop Framework GuineaPIG. 

GuineaPig is a lightweight Python library that is similar to Pig. The workflows in GuineaPIG are expressed  using high level constructs (such as Join, Augment etc.) and it spawns off MapReduce tasks behind the scenes to do the compute. GuineaPig provides for you a layer of abstraction over bare-bones Hadoop. More information about GuineaPig (including a tutorial) can be found at http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/w/courses/index.php/Guinea_Pig.
