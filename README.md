# Machine Leanrning for Large Datasets

This repository contains implementations for different machine learning models for large datasets. Thay are briefly summarized below:

1. **NaiveBayes MapReduce for Large Data** - Implements training a Naive Bayes classifier for document classification
2. **GuineaPIG Document Classification for Large Data** - Uses the mapreduce abstraction GuineaPIG for training a Naive Bayes document classifier
3. **Multinomial Regression for Large Data** - Implements the lazy sparse SGD method for classifying a very set of documents
4. **Automatic Differentiation (MLP)** - Implements the autograd or automatic differentiation using wengert lists for a multi layer perceptron.
5. **Automatic Differentiation (LSTM)** - Implements the autograd or automatic differentiation using wengert lists for an LSTM.
6. **LDA for Large Data** - Implements LDA using Gibbs Sampling and trains on large datsets using the JBosen parameter server
